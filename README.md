# Real-Time-Social-Media-Analytics

Overview
This project implements a real-time data pipeline to process over 1 million social media posts daily, leveraging Python and NLP for sentiment analysis. 
The pipeline achieves 85% sentiment analysis accuracy and reduces reporting latency by 40% through optimized data processing with Hadoop and actionable insights visualized in Power BI dashboards.

Features
1. Real-Time Data Processing: Processes 1M+ social media posts per day efficiently.
2. Sentiment Analysis: Implements advanced NLP models for high-accuracy analysis (85%).
3. Optimized Data Pipeline: Reduces reporting latency by 40% with Hadoop integration.
4. Interactive Dashboards: Visualizes trends and insights in Power BI for quick decision-making.

Architecture

Data Ingestion: Collects data from social media APIs.
Data Processing: Cleans, analyzes, and processes data using Python and NLP libraries.
Data Storage: Utilizes Hadoop for distributed storage and processing.
Visualization: Displays actionable insights using Power BI dashboards.
